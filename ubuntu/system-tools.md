# System and other tools & related

## Shortcut to install the systems tools:
```
sudo apt install synaptic git g++ cmake gfortran gnuplot gsl-bin grace
```

### Install synaptic package manager
```
sudo apt install synaptic
```

### Install git
Git should be automatically installed, but in case not:
```
sudo apt install git
``` 

### Install g++ and cmake (and gfortran too)

Although `gcc` is installed by default, `g++` is not and neither is the tool `cmake`. Below, gfortran is also installed:

```
sudo apt install g++ cmake gfortran
```

### Application launcers
Some systems come with application launcers, other don't. [Ulauncer](https://ulauncher.io/) is one great option
